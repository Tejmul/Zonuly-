"""Knowledge graph — the pipeline's data and the project's context in one queryable graph.

Two layers share one node/edge store inside jobhunter.db:

  data     mirrors of Company / Job / Contact / Email / Reply rows plus the resume
           profile, linked the way the funnel links them (job -> company -> contact ->
           email -> reply). Rebuilt by `sync.sync_all()`; never hand-edited.

  context  what the code cannot tell you: the architecture drafts, every feature each
           one proposed, which decision adopted or dropped it, the gaps still open,
           the failure modes, the open questions, and dated session notes. Seeded from
           knowledge/context.yaml; grown by `kg note`.

`brief.write()` renders the graph into knowledge/BRIEF.md so a fresh session (human or
model) starts with the context instead of rebuilding it. `compose.compose()` walks the
context layer to pick, per pipeline stage, the best feature across all drafts for a
given problem statement — the "ten architectures, take the best of each" operation.
