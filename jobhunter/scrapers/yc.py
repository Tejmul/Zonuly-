"""Y Combinator company feed -> ATS discovery -> jobs.

Work at a Startup's job API needs a login, so instead we take the public YC
company directory (the yc-oss open mirror), keep the ones that are hiring in our
space, discover which public ATS board each uses, and scrape that. Discovered
boards are cached on the Company row so later runs skip the probing entirely.
